# My mini JavaScript projects

### Most of these projects were made with Node.js, so no front-end, just back-end
#### Most if not all of these projects are little things here and there to test certain concepts  i learn, don't expect a real production application here, i'd have a different repo for all those
#### in most of these i use an NPM package called readline-sync to make my projects more interactive and chalk to make them pretty üëç
